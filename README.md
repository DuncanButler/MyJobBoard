Reference project for technologies and ideas


## Introduction:
The idea for the project is to try out different technologies and solutions to common problems, for example how to roll out projects within a solution.  This will be a monolith repo, with websites, services and microservices along with data storeage and ci/cd code, along with the infrastructure.  Each of these services etc. will be deployed by its own defined pipeline, or instructions will be supplied on how to deploy from a local machine, for testing.

Each project will have its own readme, to describe its contents, along with any notes on how to deploy, additional information will be provided in the attendent blog posts at:
